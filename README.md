# My Personal Project


## Song Cover Organizer.

My application will be the hub for all the songs covered/performed by talented or casual musicians who are interested in keeping up to date 
on their video analytics and overall growth as a music content creator. Hub, in this case, refers to a place where raw data,
including but not limited to, song title, featured instrument, view count, like/dislike count, is stored and, upon request, converted into meaningful information. 
This information will be in the form of a generated list that to shows the top x, where x is specified by the user, most viewed, liked or disliked videos and 
graphs detailing key analytics over a specified period. Alongside the addition and deletion of data, favoriting songs that can be displayed in a list will also be a feature.
Such information could potentially improve the quality of future videos as they taylor their style to match their audience's wants and needs.

This project interests me because I have been playing acoustic guitar for three years (self-taught) and 
have only recently worked up the courage to record myself performing song covers as a way to archive my progress and to 
see how much I have improved; this thirst for improvement which coincides with **the goal** of this project which is to facilitate progression
for musicians of all kinds.
